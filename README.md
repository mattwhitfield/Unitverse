## History

Unitverse was originally the SentryOne Unit Test Generator, and was written as part of an 'innovation sprint' where we wanted to write something that made our work more efficient. Unitverse is a fork of that project, and is not affiliated with any particular company. The license has also changed from Apache to MIT - please see the [license update notice](LicenseUpdateNotice.md) for details of this change. Thanks to all the original members of the team, as well as people who have submitted code/issues since then.
